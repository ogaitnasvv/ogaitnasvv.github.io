## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1: 

    This was my first lab, and it was such a fun and exciting experience. It gave me my first look at what I’ll do in the future. The lab was an introduction to computer science, and I enjoyed learning the basics of programming. I liked getting hands-on experience with coding and starting to understand how things work. It made me feel more confident and curious about what’s ahead. Overall, this lab was a great start to my journey, and it left me excited to keep learning and improving in computer science.

Lab 7: 

    This lab was challenging because we had to figure out how to program using parking signs. At first, it was hard to understand how to start, and it took some time to figure things out. Even though it was tough, I thought it was fun because I got to practice solving problems and using what I’ve learned. Once I understood how it worked, I could finish the lab quickly. It was a good learning experience and helped me feel more confident about programming.

Lab 12:

    This lab was tough, and I had some problems at the start. Even though it was challenging, I could finish it in the end. It’s special to me because it was the last lab of my first semester, and it felt like a significant accomplishment. Completing it made me proud and gave me the confidence to continue my career.
